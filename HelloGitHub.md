# Hello GitHub

_I hope everything will be ok_
**It is another text about my job**
## We need to learn English, it is very important in our future

1. Create account on Github.com
2. Create local repozitory
3. "To make friendship" between local and remote repozitory. GitHub will send tips how to do that.
4. Send (push) your local repozitory in remote on the GitHub. For that we will need to log in where is remote repository placed.
5. To make change from another computer.
6. Use command "pull" for sharing changes with local repository.
It is enough for starting to work with GitHub and sharing our work with other programmist.
